=============

Ontology API abstractions for Snorocket.

Version 3.0.0 reverts back to depending on OWL-API 4.x to regain compatibility with Protege

Version 3.1.0 now supports use of SNOMED's MRCM AttributeDomain reference set to determine which attributes are not role-grouped by default

Version 3.2.0 refuses to use infered relationships if OWL Axioms are available
